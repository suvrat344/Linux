#!/bin/awk -f

# You are the disk jockey at a local radio station.Your job is to create a playlist of songs to play in the upcoming event of New    Year's Eve.You have a dataset of songs available to be played.As most people will be at a party, you want to play songs that are     upbeat and danceable.For this you decide to play only musics in a major scale and with a BPM (beats per minute) of at least 120. But if a music has a danceability higher than 80% despite not satisfying the above condition, you will still consider it. As it is a New Year's Eve party, you only want to play songs that are released in this year itself. The current year is stored as an environment    variable `YEAR` when your script is run.
# Given the dataset `spotify.csv` containing details about songs on Spotify music streaming platform, write a script using awk to    find the songs that you will play in the upcoming event of New Year's Eve. The output should be in the order of the original dataset.To test multiple test cases, assume that the dataset is given to your script in standard input.
# Write your solution as a awk script.
# Output should be in the format:
# ```text
# track_name - artist(s)_name
# Input Format
# track_name,artist(s)_name,artist_count,released_year,released_month,released_day,in_spotify_playlists,in_spotify_charts,streams,   in_apple_playlists,in_apple_charts,in_deezer_playlists,in_deezer_charts,in_shazam_charts,bpm,key,mode,danceability_%,valence_%,energy_%,acousticness_%,instrumentalness_%,liveness_%,speechiness_%
